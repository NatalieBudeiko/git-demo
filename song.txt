I'm at a party I don't wanna be at\
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie\
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back\
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes\
Then you take my hand\
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" Hell, yeah\
You know I love you, did I ever tell you?\
You make it better like that}
