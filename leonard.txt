\f0\fs24 \cf0 I was always working steady\
But I never called it art\
I got my shit together\
Meeting Christ and reading Marx\
It failed, my little fire\
But it spread the dying spark\
Go tell the young messiah\
What happens to the heart\
\
There's a mist of summer kisses\
Where I tried to double-park\
The rivalry was vicious\
The women were in charge\
It was nothing, it was business\
But it left an ugly mark\
I've come here to revisit\
What happens to the heart}
